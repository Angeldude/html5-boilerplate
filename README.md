[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dakom/html5-boilerplate.svg?branch=barebones-react)](https://travis-ci.org/dakom/html5-boilerplate)

This is an adaptation of the barebones branch, which itself is a highly stripped-down version of the master branch

This adaptation is for a barebones React site (with routing)

To test it out - open the dev site (`npm run dev` and visit /about, /foo, and /)
